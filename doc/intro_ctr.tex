\subsection{Overview}
This and next two chapters will guide us through building
application. Bits and pieces of examples with previous configuration code
should cover mayor part of application. In opposite of real web
service, to make it simpler to read and learn, tutorial goes layer by layer of
MVC pattern. Scope of example is around one controller and it is the best
practice to map each model to corresponding controller. In this subject
ErlangWeb is very RESTful. URL in REST style still waits for stable {\it re} module. 
It is possible to write them now, but with bigger effort.
