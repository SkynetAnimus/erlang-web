\section{Known Issues}\label{knowniss}
\subsection{Derived}
\begin{enumerate}
\item one of things \emph{derived} does is passing to wparts default value and
  some initial feed for dynamically set types. It is done in two ways -- some
  clean up would be necessary.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{e\_lang}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \{Key, Value\} structure is based on keys which are lists. Should be atoms
  to improve performance.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{e\_dict}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item API. Some intenal data like current controller, path, not validated
    values is set in \emph{request dictionary} under well known
    names. Even though some API would be helpful to access dictionary and do
    not let user to over write frame work side keys.
  \item consider Ulf Wiger's points about structure of \emph{e\_dict} tables
    from ErlangWeb mailing list on SourceForge. In general, change tree into
    direct \{Key, Value\}. Performance improvement. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{XML}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item as fprof test shows, the biggest performance problem is parsing XML by
    Xmerl. Improved caching from above subsection would reduce problem but for
    now invoking Xmrl scan is too often to ignore problem.   
\end{enumerate}
