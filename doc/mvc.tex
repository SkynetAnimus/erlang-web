\section{MVC - What is What}\label{MVC}
Mayor idea of ErlangWeb architecture is make separate areas responsible for
adequate functionality. Framework consists of \emph{eptic}, \emph{wpart} and
\emph{wparts}. \emph{Eptic} communicates with \emph{wpart} and \emph{wpart}
manages \emph{wparts}. It is necessary to keep global configuration in separate
file -- it is used by many components. User's project is usually kept in
separate folder and there is place for custom modules, controllers, etc.
